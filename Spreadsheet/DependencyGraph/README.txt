1. Comments to Evaluators:

I included a bunch of test cases to check every possible case.

2. Assignment Specific Topics

I think the project will take me from 8 to 10 hours.

It took me about 12 hours to finish the project.
I spent a lot of time debugging because my code was not working and finally it was because I was missing an if-else statement.
Everything seems to be working now.
